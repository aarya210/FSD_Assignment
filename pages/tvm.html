      <h2>About</h2>
       <p>Thiruvananthapuram (or Trivandrum) is the capital of the southern Indian state of Kerala.</p>
       <p>It's distinguished by its British colonial architecture and many art galleries.</p>
       <p>It’s also home to Kuthira Malika (or Puthen Malika) Palace, adorned with carved horses and displaying collections related to the Travancore royal family, whose regional capital was here from the 18th–20th centuries</p>
       
      <h3>Places to Look out for</h3>
         <p>Though often used as a gateway to nearby beach resorts, Thiruvananthapuram offers plenty of its own to reward travellers who stay. From South Indian cuisine and a sophisticated art scene to architectural treasures and historic landmarks, there’s so much to experience in Kerala’s capital.</p>
