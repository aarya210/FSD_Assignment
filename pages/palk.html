      <h2>About</h2>
      <p> Palakkad, or Palghat, is a city in Kerala with no coastal line. The district opens the state to the rest of the country through the Palakkad</p>
       <p>The 18th-century Palakkad Fort has sturdy battlements, a moat and a Hanuman temple on its grounds.</p>
       <p> North, on the Kalpathy River, the 15th-century Viswanatha Swamy Temple is the main venue of the famous Ratholsavam chariot festival.</p>
     <p>Northeast, near Malampuzha Dam, the town of Malampuzha has a rock garden created from recycled materials.</p>
      <h3>Places to Look out for</h3>
      <p>Deriving its name from the Malayalam words Pala (Alsteriascholaris) and Kadu (forest), this place was once a stunning expanse of forest covered with the sweet-scented flowers of the Pala tree. A potpourri of Tamil and Kerala culture, some of the finest Carnatic musicians hail from this district which continues to be a principally agrarian society</p>
